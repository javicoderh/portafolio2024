          Next is actually my best stack, working together with prisma and trpc i guess is a very <br />
          functional stack specially because you can still use all the resources from React and Js. <br />
          If you check the project on the latest project section, you can find in Vuelca most of the features from <br />
          next.js, prisma and trpc, also you can find my html, css, react and postgres knowledge. <br />
