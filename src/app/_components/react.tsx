          Next is actually my best stack, working together with prisma and trpc i guess is a very <br />
          functional stack specially because you can still use all the resources from React and Js. <br />
          If you check the project on the latest project section, you can find in Vuelca most of the <br /> 
          features  from next.js, prisma and trpc, also you can find my html, css, react and postgres <br /> 
          knowledge.
