          React was my favourite framework until i met next.js, i feel very comfortable working with it, <br />
          and i can use most of react features, such as contexts, router, states, effects, lazy react and some libraries<br />
          like redux and material ui, also i can use all the features from javascript and i can add typescript<br /> 
          to my react apps, and test them with jest or react test, i can develop pipelines for react app <br /> 
          for CI/CD and conect my apps into virtual machines using docker.
