          On rust i read and practiced the entire  book of The Rust Programming Language <br />
          i also made some little softwares like a text scrapper to find some phrases or keywords, <br />
          text formatters, an Api with drinks and their recipes , among others. I am currently learning <br />
          real uses for multithreads
          <br />
          i studied smart pointers, data structures, advanced types, traits, hashmaps and other rust features. <br />
